The Cypress test tools are here.
The Cypress engine can be obtained from here freely: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress
The direct download (https://download.cypress.io/desktop) is the simplest way recently â€“ it is an all-in-one application.

The GO-related files and the Cypress core infrastructure are in two distinct directories.
So it is possible to upgrade Cypress core without touching the GO-related files.
Recently we use cypress 9.5.1.

The index.js file should be in "cypress/support" directory,
go.spec.js in "cypress/integration/3-own",
and cypress.json in the root ("cypress").
